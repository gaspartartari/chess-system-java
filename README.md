## Credits

This chess game is implemented in Java and uses object-oriented programming principles. The project structure includes packages for the game logic (`chess`), the game interface (`application`), and a basic board game framework (`boardgame`). The chess pieces are implemented as separate classes, inheriting from the `ChessPiece` abstract class.

Special thanks to the contributors who helped create this simple yet functional console chess game!
